    "If you ran through the Day 1 notebook, hopefully you're enjoying how easy it can be to make your Jetbot move around using functions, widgets and even a controller! Thats very cool!  But what's even cooler, is making your Jetbot move around all by itself! \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the Collision Avodaince task is to allow the Jetbot to move around freely until it comes across a \"dangerous situation\" then it will turn around (avoiding collision) and continue on moving freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, Firstly, we'll manually place the robot in scenarios where it's \"safety bubble\" is violated, and label these scenarios as ``blocked``.  We save a snapshot of what the robot sees along with this label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we'll manually place the robot in scenarios where it's safe to move forward, and label these scenarios as ``free``.  Likewise, we save a snapshot along with this label.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all that we'll be doing in this notebook, \"**data collection**\".  Once we have collected lots of images for the 2 classes, we'll upload this data to a GPU enabled machine where we'll *train* a neural network to predict whether the robot's safety bubble is being violated based off of the image it sees.  We'll use this to implement a simple collision avoidance behavior in the end :)"
